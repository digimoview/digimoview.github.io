-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=anime-hype---youtube-1>Anime Hype - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#anime-hype---youtube-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://yt3.ggpht.com/-FAiRUbXs2V0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/VB-aQq3EsQE/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.v0QDcl4ZLOKEb1AXUGxWyQHaHa&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Anime Hype - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hype anime.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion
